The general purpose script here is parallel.pl
It allows on to run a long list of jobs, while efficiently utilizing
up to a given number of CPU cores on a host.  This is useful
on multi-core machines when a real batch system is not available.

To use it, first prepare a text file with one command you want to run
per line.  Whatever you type in will be passed to the shell.  Then do

cat mycommands.txt | parallel.pl 5

this will start up to 5 processes, and as any one finishes will start
another until the input from mycommands.txt is exhausted.

The other scripts are helpers to run TWIST MOFIA program.
Example of use:

head rawdata.list | print_mofia_commands.sh test.kcm | parallel.pl 5
